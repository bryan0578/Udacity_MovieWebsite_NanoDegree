# Udacity_MovieWebsite_NanoDegree
A simple python webpage that displays a list of my favorite movies and tv shows and plays their trailers

##Step 1: Make sure Python is installed
Open up Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and ensure Python is installed on your system by entering the following command:
```python
s = "python --version"
print s
```
If Python is installed, this command will return “Python X.Y.Z”, where X.Y.Z is your version number. If Python is not installed, [download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

```python
s="python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080"
print s
